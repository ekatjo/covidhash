C++ code that implements a hash table utilizing the separate collision method to solve most collision problems.

<h1>How it works</h1>
This program is designed to store and manage COVID-19 data using a method called a hash table. 
A hash table helps quickly find, add, or remove information by organizing data into "buckets" based on a unique number (hash value) assigned to each country. 
The program allows users to create a database from a file, add new records, search for a country’s data, delete a country’s record, and display the entire database. 
When new data is added, the program checks if the country already exists in the database and updates the case and death counts accordingly. 
The user interacts with the program through a menu, choosing options like adding data or searching for a specific country. 
The program ensures that only the latest data is stored by comparing dates.
